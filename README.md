# ARM-CortexM4

This repository stores all the Important examples from UTAustinX's Online edX courses:

Part1: https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-10x

Part2: https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-multi-utaustinx-ut-6-20x

As well as storing my personal projects using the ARM Cortex M architecture.

The course has a series of Labs that encompass many different aspects of embedded programming. 

Why did I not include every lab? I felt it wasn't necessary as later labs include aspects from smaller previous labs (For example the first 5 labs have their examples in the "BasicSwitch" example).

The point of this repository is to store example that i've written (in this class) that cover the important aspects of embedded development.

Such as:
* Functional programming
* Basic Input/Output
* Masking and Memory Mapping Peripherals
* Timers (Such as SysTick)
* Interrupts
* Etc...

Personal Projects and HAL's will also be added in this repository. So this repo is not meant to be just a clone of all the labs. I hope some examples can prove useful to others.
